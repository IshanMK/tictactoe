Specification for is as follows:
  1. Display a 3x3 matrix of buttons.
  2. Each player gets a turn to pick a button which is not selected. If the player
     selects a button that is already selected, the system should ignore that selection
     and let the user select again until he/she picks a free button.
  3. The buttons selected by user 1 should be marked with a 1 and that for user 2 is 2
  4. User 1 gets the first chance, then user 2 gets the chance and so on.
  5. Based on the pick, the game might continue (in which case the other player
     should get his/her turn) or end with either a win to the current player or a draw.  
     When the game ends the results should be displayed in a different window.
